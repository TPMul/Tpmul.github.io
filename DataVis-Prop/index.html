    <h1>Data Visualization Project Proposal</h1>
    <p>I would like to investigate the most popular players on Dribbble and see if there is any sort of correlation between the number of followers and the styles of work that they tag.</p>
    <h2> Some things I will be looking for:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Print vs Screen popularity</li>
      <li>Color trends</li>
      <li>Systems vs one off's</li>
      <li>Seasonality</li>
    </ul>
