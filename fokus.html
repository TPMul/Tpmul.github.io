        <h2>fokus</h2>
         <h4>Photography has changed a lot since it was invented however the biggest shift in it’s history is the smartphone. Fokus blends the benefits from film and those from smartphones to give control back to the users and teach them along the way.</h4>
         <p>Smartphone photography is growing popularity and is taking over many of the areas that have been reserved for hobbists with DSLR’s and professional photographers. One suchspace is flickr where their data shows that four out of the top five cameras used are iPhones ranging from the 5s-4 all of which beat out any DSLR for popularity. Rather than fight this trend I saw this platform as a way to bring some of the power from film into the current market place with a new type of photo app that doesn’t let you apply filters to fix boring images, instead it gives you the controls and teaches you how to compose and create a beautiful image on your own, that you can proudly share with your friends and family.<br><br> Fokus is made up of two distinct components, the app and the web, the app component which is dedicated for shooting and creating the image, the image is then handed off to the website which is where users learn to reflect on what they shot and evaulate themselves to learn from their photos. The site also has a community aspect where people can learn from the top users as well.</p>
         <h3>App Screens</h3>
         <img src="images/fokus1-large.jpg">
         <p>This is the introduction screen of the app that informs users as to what this app is about.</p>
         <img src="images/fokus2-large.jpg">
         <p>Fokus teaches the users how to control the camera one control at a time, rather than just throwing all the controls at the user at once.</p>
         <img src='images/fokus0-large.jpg'>
         <p> Once a control is introduced the app gives users a trial period with only that function in order to understand what it does and how to use it.</p>
         <br>
         <h3>Web Screens</h3>
         <img src="images/fokus3-large.jpg">
         <p>After the user has taken their photos the images are uploaded to the website where they can browse all of their images and share them. This screen shows the user's albums.</p>
         <img src="images/fokus4-large.jpg">
         <p>Inside the album all of the images are displayed with the time and date as well as the user generated ratings, which are required in order to share, forcing the user to reflect and learn from what they have shot.</p>
         <img src="images/fokus5-large.jpg">
         <p>Single photo view allows the user to look at the fine details as far as the exposure and composition as well as the meta data for each individual image to see what works and what does not.</p>
         <img src="images/fokus6-large.jpg">
         <p>As mention above the website also contains a social aspect to it, users can share and critique friends as well as explore the best rated images, these best rated images can also be sorted based on the metadata allowing users to learn from the best and filter to see their specific phone.</p>
