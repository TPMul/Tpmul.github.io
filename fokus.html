        <h2>fokus</h2>
         <h4>Photography has changed a lot since it was invented however the biggest shift in it’s history is the smartphone. Fokus blends the benefits from film and those from smartphones to give control back to the users and teach them along the way.</h4>
         <p>Smartphone photography is growing popularity and is taking over many of the areas that have been reserved for hobbists with DSLR’s and professional photographers. One suchspace is flickr where their data shows that four out of the top five cameras used are iPhones ranging from thr 5s-4 all of which beat out any DSLR for popularity. Rather than fight this trend I saw this platform as a way to bring some of the power from film into the current market place with a new type of photo app that doesn’t let you apply filters to fix boring images, instead it gives you the controls and teaches you how to compose and create a beautiful image on your own, that you can proudly share with your friends and family. Fokus is made up of the app component which is dedicated for shooting and creating the image, the image is then handed off to the website which is where users learn to reflect on what they shot and evaulate themselves to learn from their photos. The site also has a community aspect where people can learn from the top users as well.</p>
